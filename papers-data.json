With such externalities to nonusers, standard consumer surplus measures, which take aggregate consumption as given, fail to appropriately capture consumer welfare.

Incentivized experiments with college students indicate positive welfare based on the standard measure but negative welfare when accounting for these nonuser externalities.

Exploiting a lottery in assessment, a causal mediation analysis shows the overall positive peer effect reflects a positive effect on application behavior (conditional on GPA).

Using an estimated model of monopsonistic local labor markets, it finds that minimum wage hikes and labor demand shocks drove the decline in Brazilian wage inequality from 1998 to 2012. While rising educational attainment compressed skill premiums within firms, it also reallocated skilled workers to high-wage firms, limiting that shock’s effect on inequality. The analysis highlights interactions among exogenous factors, showing that concurrent supply and demand changes attenuated minimum wage impacts. (JEL J22, J23, J24, J31, J38, J42, R23)</jats:p>",

We specify a general equilibrium model with these features to quantify the aggregate effects of simulated tariff shocks on wages.

This is because some attributes of the incentives become opaque; that is, workers do not take them into account. In our setting, workers overprovide effort relative to a fully rational benchmark, improving efficiency. We identify contract features, and facets of worker cognitive ability, that matter for opacity. We find that even relatively small degrees of opacity can cause large shifts in behavior. Our results illustrate important implications of complexity and bounded rationality for designing and regulating workplace incentive contracts. (JEL C90, D21, D91, J22, J31, J41)</jats:p>",

Through a battery of tests, we show that the occurrence of disasters in neighboring counties triggers inventory stockpiling, an effect that is unlikely to be driven by the real disaster disruptions. Our results also indicate that inventory stockpiling is likely inconsistent with a rational expectations equilibrium.

Using textual analysis of 264,443 works printed in England between 1500 and 1900, we test whether British culture manifested a belief in progress associated with science and industry. Our analysis yields three main findings. First, there was a separation in the languages of science and religion beginning in the mid-18th century. Second, volumes using language at the nexus of science and political economy became more progress-oriented during the Enlightenment. Third, volumes using industrial language—especially those at the science-political economy nexus—were more progress-oriented beginning in the 18th century.</jats:p>",

Quantitatively, bond funds provide 12.5% of the liquidity that banks provide per dollar. Our model further shows that when equity values incorporate the liquidation cost from re demptions, as in swing pricing, liquidity provision is not necessarily reduced. This is because swing pricing may increase funds’ capacity for holding illiquid assets without inducing panic runs. (JEL G01, G21, G23, G28)</jats:p>",

This effect is unexplained by abnormal price reactions, traditional news, and analyst recommendations. Consistent with manager learning, the informativeness of social media strengthens after firms start corporate Twitter accounts. The informativeness is driven by longer acquisition‐related tweets by fundamental investors, rather than memes and price trend tweets. These findings suggest that social media signals can be important for corporate decisions.</jats:p>",

Controlling for various other factors of executive financial misconduct, we find that executives are significantly more likely to engage in financial misconduct, including accounting, tax, and other financial offenses, if their parents have a history of financial misconduct. This intergenerational association is stronger when the parental misconduct is more severe. Additional findings reveal that growing up in high‐misconduct municipalities and cohabiting with spouses who engage in financial misconduct are also associated with a higher likelihood of executive misconduct, indicating that such behaviors may be shaped by broader socialization processes that extend beyond the immediate family. Although our analyses do not establish causal relationships, the collective evidence presented in this study offers insights into why some corporate executives engage in misconduct while others do not.</jats:p>",

We find consistent evidence of persistent abnormal profits among U.S. Big 4 engagements and that individual offices earn persistent abnormal returns, suggesting that the market is not perfectly competitive. Examining the consequences of lower competition, we find that profit persistence is negatively related to audit hours and positively related to audit quality. Although we are cautious about inferring causality, our findings suggest that lower competition is associated with more efficient and effective audits.</jats:p>",

We use this variation to document significant increases in drug-related mortality and greater reliance on public transfer programs. This induced economic hardship led to substantial changes in the political landscape of the communities most affected by the opioid epidemic. We estimate that from the mid-2000s to 2022, exposure to the opioid epidemic continuously increased the Republican vote share in House, presidential, and gubernatorial elections. By the 2022 House elections, a one-standard-deviation increase in our measure of exposure led to a 4.5 percentage point increase in the Republican vote share. From 2012 until 2022, this increase in the House vote share translated into Republicans winning additional seats.</jats:p>",

Bank losses are primarily driven by write-downs of nonperforming assets, not asset sales during panics. Forceful liquidity-based interventions during crises predict only small, temporary increases in bank market value. Overall, these results suggest that bank losses during crises are not primarily due to temporary price dislocations.

Using a regression discontinuity design, I find that firms subject to incremental reporting regulation obtain more bank credit primarily through cash flow–based lending, term loans, and long‐term debt, without higher interest rates. These findings are explained by stronger banking competition and greater reliance on financial statement data. However, firms do not expand their net financial position, as bank credit substitutes for other liabilities, and exhibit weaker performance consistent with the costs of reporting regulation. This evidence from a different setting offers new insights into how reporting regulation influences credit contracting for private firms and strengthens the empirical basis for policy‐making.</jats:p>",

Using large cuts in industry-level import tariff rates as a setting, we find that domestic firms respond to a looming competitive threat from foreign rivals by raising cost rigidity. This increase cannot plausibly be explained by investments to create physical excess capacity, suggesting firms enter cost commitments for labor and procurement instead. Additional tests corroborate the hypothesized preemptive intent. First, the increase in cost rigidity is concentrated in industries in which a firm’s aggressive market stance elicits a softening of competition. Second, it is only in these industries that firms with rigid cost structures experience market share gains around a large tariff cut. The latter effect is more pronounced the more reliably firms’ cost structures can be discerned from their financial statements. Overall, our study suggests that firms enter cost commitments as a preemptive strategy.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Data Availability: Data are available from the public sources cited in the text.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>JEL Classifications: L22; M21; M40; M41.</jats:p>",

It is based on my Presidential Scholar Lecture at the 2024 American Accounting Association Annual Meeting. In 2012, the Pathways Commission outlined the need and a path for more practitioners to join academia (Behn et al. 2012), and my academic career advanced partly due to that initiative. Earning a Doctor of Business Administration (D.B.A.) degree from University of Florida allowed me to support my school as a scholarly academic and pursue research that enhances my teaching and provided me with a path to administration as a nontenure track faculty member.</jats:p>",

This study examines whether a common control choice—framing pay raise budgets in percentages—contributes to perpetuating pay gaps. We predict that when the pay raise budget is framed as a percentage (the percentage frame), it inadvertently nudges managers to anchor individual raises on that budget percentage, thereby impounding prior salaries, and thus, existing inequities, into pay raises. We further predict that framing the pay raise budget as an absolute amount (the dollar frame) can un-nudge this behavior. As expected, we find in two experiments that the dollar frame perpetuates pay gaps less than the percentage frame, and that this difference is robust to varying levels of ambiguity about the source of salary differences. Our study examines a simple, cost-effective way to limit the perpetuation of pay gaps.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Data Availability: Contact the authors.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>JEL Classifications: D91; J16; J31; J71; M40; M52.</jats:p>",

Moreover, the misstatement data-generating process is evolving due to regulatory regime shifts, further complicating the evaluation of model predictions. We design an approach that accounts for detection lags and continuously updates models to adapt to the changing data-generating process. By comparing with the conventional approach that ignores detection lags, we show that the look-ahead bias can substantially inflate prediction performance. We also demonstrate that although leaving a temporal gap between training and test samples can mitigate the look-ahead bias, it sacrifices the model’s predictive power by disconnecting the dynamic data-generating process between training and test periods. We further implement a trading strategy to evaluate the practical utility of the continuously updating approach.

Based on the behavioral life-cycle model, we predict payment timing influences how recipients spend government transfers, but that this effect is muted when the transfer payment is combined with other income. In contrast to prior research, our experimental findings provide theory-consistent results and suggest recipients of a periodic transfer spend more of the transfer than recipients of a lump sum transfer, but only when the transfer is standalone and not combined. Our findings help to explain theory-inconsistent results of prior research and extend the literature on the behavioral life-cycle model and mental budgeting. Moreover, our results suggest policymakers can intentionally structure the distribution of government transfers to encourage household spending or saving consistent with policy goals.</jats:p>",

We document that mandatory IFRS adoption is associated with a significantly larger improvement in the quality of analysts’ information environment for U.S. firms with relatively few domestic industry peers than for other U.S. firms. Further, we show that there is a larger increase in the frequency with which analysts’ research reports for U.S. firms with few domestic peers mention IFRS-adopting EU industry peer firms.

Using hand-collected data to capture disclosure quality of CSR reports and intensity of CSR contracting (i.e., scope, importance, and degree to which CSR metrics are incorporated) for S&amp;P 500 firms, we show that firms indeed align the design choices of the two practices. In addition, firms using both practices intensively are associated with a stronger CSR commitment and more credible CSR disclosures.

Children from families in the top 1% are more than twice as likely to attend an Ivy-Plus college as those from middle-class families with comparable SAT/ACT scores. Two-thirds of this gap is due to higher admissions rates for students with comparable test scores from high-income families; the remaining third is due to differences in rates of application and matriculation. In contrast, children from high-income families have no admissions advantage at flagship public colleges. The high-income admissions advantage at Ivy-Plus colleges is driven by three factors: (1) preferences for children of alumni, (2) weight placed on non-academic credentials, and (3) athletic recruitment. Using a new research design that isolates idiosyncratic variation in admissions decisions for waitlisted applicants, we show that attending an Ivy-Plus college instead of the average flagship public college increases students- chances of reaching the top 1% of the earnings distribution by 50%, nearly doubles their chances of attending an elite graduate school, and almost triples their chances of working at a prestigious firm. The three factors that give children from high-income families an admissions advantage are uncorrelated or negatively correlated with post-college outcomes, whereas academic credentials such as SAT/ACT scores are highly predictive of post-college success.</jats:p>",

Labor market factors predict firms’ strategies better than firm characteristics. Survey responses from nearly 10,000 full-time workers indicate that most workers provide their salary expectations before they receive a job offer. Most outside offers are rejected, with the worker remaining at the incumbent firm. There is substantial heterogeneity in workers’ bargaining behavior, which translates into within-firm wage inequality.

Using data on portfolio stock transactions between 2016 and 2021, we show that, while all investors exhibit a significant disposition effect before 2018, that is, a greater propensity to realize gains than losses, highly advised investors see their bias significantly reduced afterward. Our paper shows financial firms can successfully reduce clients’ biases by appropriately manipulating advisors’ information.</jats:p>",

Remarkably, this two-regime pattern is completely reversed for macro factors. Mutual fund and hedge fund returns corroborate these findings.

Cities more dependent on land sales and land-backed debt before the pandemic experienced greater price increases and price–volume divergence, with LGFVs buying more land at higher prices than other buyers.

We present estimates of both behavioral and contextual peer effects, along with comprehensive evidence on how students’ own and their peers’ app usage affect academic performance, physical health, and labor market outcomes. Our analysis draws on administrative data from a Chinese university covering three student cohorts over four years. We exploit random roommate assignments, differential exposure to a policy shock (gaming restrictions for minors), and differential exposure to a discrete event (the introduction of a blockbuster video game) for identification. App usage is contagious: a one s.d. increase in roommates’ in-college app usage raises own usage by 5.8%. High app usage is harmful across all measured outcomes. A one s.d. increase in app usage reduces GPAs by 36.2% of a within-cohort-major s.d. and lowers wages by 2.3%. Roommates’ app usage reduces a student’s GPAs and wages through both disruptions and behavioral spillovers, generating a total negative effect that exceeds half the magnitude of the impact from the student’s own app usage. Extending China’s three-hour-per-week gaming restriction for minors to college students would boost their initial wages by 0.9%. High-frequency GPS and app usage data show that heavy app users spend less time in study halls, are more frequently late or absent from class, and get less sleep.</jats:p>",

Using a structural equation model that jointly determines monetary and nonmonetary sanctions, we find that monitor assignments are related to the nature of the offense, violation severity, and investor harm. We also find that monitors with targeted accounting oversight responsibilities are associated with improved corporate culture, a higher likelihood of financial restatements during their tenure, and enhanced financial reporting credibility at the firms they oversee relative to enforcement firms without such monitors.

However, individuals may hesitate to rely on algorithmic output, particularly under conditions of uncertainty. We conduct two experiments examining whether and how a system’s ability to adapt—an emerging feature of machine learning—interacts with uncertainty to influence accounting professionals’ reliance on algorithmic advice. In Experiment 1, we find that auditors are more willing to rely on advice from learning algorithms than static algorithms when estimation uncertainty is relatively high. Experiment 2 replicates this result in a general accounting context where preparers develop their own estimates. Our findings demonstrate that accounting professionals’ reliance on algorithms is contextually dependent, and highlights algorithm adaptability as an important technological feature that can promote advice utilization, particularly when adaptability is likely important to the judgment context (e.g., when estimation uncertainty is high).</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>JEL Classifications: M40; M41; M42; O30; O32; O33.</jats:p>",

In sum, my opinion is that the future is bright and full of opportunities for tax scholars. Governments are altering corporate income tax laws in fundamental ways and questions about how these changes affect investment, investment location, income shifting, corporate capital structure, and financial reporting will be very important aspects to study. New and newly used taxes, such as tariffs and endowment taxes, will allow for novel paths of inquiry and accountants should contribute. The use of AI by tax authorities and taxpayers could alter both tax enforcement and tax planning. The increasing access to administrative data, the use of field experiments and field studies, and employing survey methods to obtain data should expand the settings available to study and improve identification.</jats:p>",

Tests examining multiple analysts forecasting on the same focal firm at the same time find that individual analysts overweight idiosyncratic local news and underweight news from economically linked firms that are not in their coverage portfolios. Market prices track the analyst bias from local news, leading to predictable and economically significant return reversal patterns in the future.

Specifically, secondees bridge gaps in the GNF structure by brokering network ties, technical knowledge, sociocultural knowledge, and language. Secondees embody different brokerage roles and can fulfill more than one brokerage role at a time, depending on the purpose of the secondment and the stage of deployment. Collectively, secondments are important mechanisms by which structural holes are reduced between participating member firms and proximal member firms, ultimately benefiting the global firm and the global clients they serve.</jats:p>",

The MCDC granted favorable settlement terms to municipal debt issuers and underwriters who voluntarily self-reported having violated SEC disclosure requirements. Although underwriters participated widely, most municipal issuers did not participate in the MCDC initiative despite having publicly observable disclosure violations. We find that, after the MCDC, official statements were less likely to contain false claims about past compliance—particularly when underwriters had participated—suggesting improved underwriter oversight of the initial bond offering. However, contrary to the SEC’s intention, we observe a 9 percent post-MCDC decrease in issuers’ compliance with continuing disclosure requirements compared with a control group of voluntarily disclosing issuers.

First, study the heterogeneity in management accounting practices across industries and embrace single-industry research deep dives. Second, focus on the role of management accounting in decision-making, planning, and forecasting. Third, explore the connections of management accounting with other subfields in accounting as well as other business disciplines.</jats:p>",

Drawing from a sample of the United Kingdom Premium Listed companies with goodwill on their balance sheets during 2014–2019, we identify instances where goodwill impairment is flagged as a KAM and contrast firms’ disclosure levels on goodwill impairment using textual measures constructed from information in their annual reports. We find that firm disclosure on goodwill impairment increases (decreases) when auditors start (stop) mentioning goodwill impairment as a KAM. The increase in disclosure is more pronounced in the presence of stronger external information demand and better internal governance. Finally, firms are more likely to impair goodwill in the period following auditors’ mention of goodwill impairment as a KAM. Overall, this paper establishes the role of the expanded audit report for firm disclosure.</jats:p>",

Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence, we identify key predictive features, including comprehensive income, foreign firm status, and accrued interest and penalties from unrecognized tax benefits. Results show that investors achieve better outcomes using a proactive investment strategy based on our prediction models than reactive detection models. Furthermore, our prediction model can help managers prevent internal control weaknesses, assist auditors in assessing misstatement risks in advance, and enable regulators to allocate inspection resources proactively.

To reconcile this puzzling evidence, we show that uncertainty predicts lower aggregate depreciation of existing capital, which dominates the investment slowdown. We explain these findings by developing a quantitative production-based model in which firms implement precautionary savings through reducing utilization rather than raising investment. Through this novel intensive-margin mechanism, uncertainty shocks command a quarter of the equity premium in general equilibrium. Flexibility in utilization adjustments also helps explain uncertainty risk exposures in the cross-section of industry returns.</jats:p>",

The listing and transaction probabilities of neighboring properties decrease in intermediary attention. These results contrast sharply with endogenous correlations and provide causal evidence that intermediaries resolve property-level frictions deriving from search, information, or behavioral considerations but do not mitigate neighborhood-level information asymmetries.</jats:p>",

Using compensation data for 14,111 nonprofits, we find that CEO pay dropped by 2% after legislation in New York reduced CEOs’ ability to influence their own pay. Despite lower pay, CEOs exerted more effort, and nonprofit performance improved. The effects were stronger at commercial nonprofits than at charities and for male CEOs than female CEOs. These findings are consistent with a model where some nonprofit CEOs derive meaning from their work and compensation can be rigged. Overall, our results suggest that regulation that targets the pay-setting process can improve organizational outcomes at nonprofits.</jats:p>",

Pegger currencies depreciate relative to floater currencies and these depreciations are strongly expansionary. The boom is associated with a fall in net exports, and (if anything) an increase in interest rates in the pegger countries. This suggests that expenditure switching and domestic monetary policy are not the main drivers of the boom. We show that a large class of existing models cannot match our estimated responses and develop a model with imperfect financial openness that can. Following a depreciation, uncovered interest parity deviations lower the costs of borrowing from abroad and stimulate the economy, as in the data. The model is consistent with (unconditional) exchange rate disconnect and the Mussa fact, even though exchange rates have large effects on the economy.</jats:p>",

High‐reputation banks originated better mortgages and issued securities that, on average, retained 17.5% more of their value during a market collapse. Reputational effects are attenuated when the managing partners were married into wealth or received a large share of profits in the short term, suggesting that bank reputation only works if bankers are personally exposed to (long‐run) reputational losses.</jats:p>",

When candidates compete for promotions by investing in skills, firms' subtle biases induce discriminated candidates to overinvest when promotions are low‐stakes (to distinguish themselves from favored candidates) but underinvest in high‐stakes settings (anticipating low promotion probabilities). This asymmetry implies that subtle discrimination raises profits in low‐productivity firms but lowers them in high‐productivity firms. Although subtle biases are small, they generate large gaps in skills and promotion outcomes.

Using French administrative data, we find that firms experience a 13% increase in bank credit after receiving a FinTech loan. We use propensity score matching procedures and a shift-share instrument to account for credit demand. The credit increase only occurs when FinTech borrowers invest in new assets, and Fintech borrowers are subsequently more likely to pledge collateral to banks. This suggests that firms use FinTech loans to acquire assets that they then pledge to banks, thereby increasing total borrowing capacity.</jats:p>",

We develop an approach integrating OpenAI's GPT‐4 with Chain‐of‐Thought prompting to classify race and ethnicity. In our validation tests, this method achieves higher accuracy than several tested open‐source algorithms. Our main findings are as follows. First, although firms headquartered in protest‐affected counties add more Black directors, particularly in larger protests, this gain appears to largely offset the representation of other non‐Black minority directors. Second, these board‐level shifts do not consistently extend to executives or the general workforce. In contrast, a gap may emerge between a firm's workforce composition and local labor‐market demographics, particularly in the representation of Black employees. This pattern is consistent with diversity tokenism, which suggests firms may prioritize high‐visibility board appointments and potentially downplay broader, transformative change. Our findings indicate that although board‐level diversity gains are highly visible and attract notable public attention, they may not be accompanied by an organization's transformative commitment to company‐wide diversity.</jats:p>",

Using a tax law change with an estimable and material GAAP earnings impact, we find that analysts’ GAAP forecasts generally fail to incorporate this impact, whereas investors respond promptly, suggesting that GAAP forecasts omit earnings information deemed relevant by investors and are of low quality. Analyzing quarterly GAAP forecasts from 2004–2019 and classifying GAAP forecasts that equal their street counterparts when GAAP and street actuals differ as low quality, we again find widespread low GAAP forecast quality. Low quality GAAP forecasts affect research inferences: they dampen GAAP earnings response coefficient (ERC) estimates, reduce the explanatory power of GAAP surprises for returns, affect inferences regarding market rewards for meeting-or-beating via exclusions, and understate the extent that GAAP forecasts incorporate exclusion components. We propose two strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of low quality GAAP forecasts on research inferences.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Data Availability: Data are from publicly available sources as identified within the manuscript.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>JEL Classifications: G14; M40; M41.</jats:p>",

We interview 27 QC system leaders to understand how they navigate the challenges they face in changing QC systems. We find that many challenges—including obtaining buy-in, evaluating costs and benefits, and advancing proactive over reactive changes—are caused by conflicting demands arising internally. Consistent with institutional theory, our data reveal that leaders respond to conflicting demands by seeking partial conformity (e.g., negotiating among stakeholders) or by altering the framing of the demands (e.g., using scientific logic to legitimize a QC change). Interviews of eight QC system users complement and corroborate our main results and suggest opportunities for future research.

Using differences in compliance requirements with Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) Section 404, we find that adoption of Section 404 increased firms’ propensity for nonfinancial violations. This effect is stronger for firms with greater external scrutiny toward their financial reporting, greater challenges in monitoring their operations, and limited resources. These results, together with an examination of changes in audit fees, conference call transcripts, and 10-K disclosures, suggest that the effects primarily stem from a shift in attention and resources toward SOX 404. Further, the effects are concentrated in employee-related violations and persist for approximately two years.

The results of our experiment support our theory. Consistent with prior literature, we find that without RPE, employees respond significantly more negatively to managerial monitoring compared to no monitoring. However, we find that the effect of managerial monitoring on employee responses is moderated in the presence of RPE—employees respond similarly regardless of whether their manager implements a monitoring control. We provide robust analyses to support our theory-derived mechanisms, demonstrating that our results are driven by employees’ fairness perceptions of managers’ monitoring decisions.

Drawing on finance theory, which posits that lenders possess private information about borrowers, I hypothesize that lenders price cybersecurity risks into loan contracts. A priori, this relation is unclear, given the unpredictable nature of cybersecurity risk and the difficulty lenders face in assessing the likelihood and magnitude of associated losses. Using the private debt market, I find a positive association between cybersecurity risk and the cost of debt. This relation is weaker for borrowers with high-quality information technology and stronger in less competitive lending markets. I also find that, following successful cyberattacks, secondary market loan prices decline (increase) for borrowers with high (low) ex ante cybersecurity risk.

I document that firms dependent on R&amp;D alliance revenues accelerate revenue recognition and expand revenue-related disclosures following ASC 606 adoption. These concurrent changes reduce information asymmetry, both between firms and between managers and investors, but only when increased disclosure accompanies accelerated recognition. Consistent with these net reductions in information asymmetry, affected firms raise more equity capital and increase R&amp;D investment. Notably, these firms, which historically acted as technology providers (principals), form more R&amp;D alliances as technology acquirers (partners). Consequently, they exhibit higher innovation output, measured by new patents and drug candidates. This study identifies a specific mechanism through which accounting standards can stimulate innovation: reduced information asymmetry that facilitates strategic R&amp;D alliance formation.</jats:p>",

We examine unintended consequences of using a management control system to promote and reward OCBs. Specifically, because OCB transcends preestablished core job performance criteria, valuation of OCB necessarily relies on subjective judgments, allowing gender stereotypes to manifest. Using proprietary data from a financial services firm, we examine two types of OCBs: agentic and communal OCBs. Consistent with gender stereotypes, women are less likely to participate in agentic OCB and more likely to participate in communal OCB. Consistent with “shifting standards” theory, we find that men obtain a significant evaluation premium for communal OCB, whereas women obtain a marginal evaluation premium for agentic OCB.

A manager chooses between two projects that are ex ante financially equivalent: a “green” one aligned with investor preferences and a “brown” one that is not (e.g., due to environmental or social concerns). The success of the project depends on matching the investment with the state of nature. Because responsible investors prefer to hold green firms, trading is more informative when the firm signals green, strengthening market feedback. Anticipating this, the manager may misreport a brown signal as green to attract responsible investors.

Relative to observably similar individuals from the same draft board, Black men randomly inducted into the Army were significantly more likely to join the nascent NAACP and become prominent community leaders in the New Negro era.

An emerging view contends that if a country invoices its exports in dollars, exchange rates cannot stabilize economic activity, as the classical expenditure-switching channel is muted. This view rests on the premise that export prices are sticky in dollars, breaking the link between export demand and depreciations. But this assumption is not borne out by the data: goods priced in dollars tend to have more flexible prices, along with higher elasticities of substitution. We propose a model with more realistic assumptions and show that even with dollar pricing, depreciating the currency by loosening monetary policy can still boost exports and activity materially. The limit to any expansion is not demand, but supply capacity. We also show that low exchange rate pass-through to dollar prices is not informative about price stickiness. The price response to exchange rates is small when demand elasticities are high, even with flexible prices: low pass-through is an equilibrium result, not evidence of a nominal friction.</jats:p>",

Descriptive analyses suggest exponential growth in corporate crypto holdings and significant variation in crypto accounting practices, underscoring the rule's necessity. Hypothesis tests using the pre‐rule data reveal three insights with direct relevance to the rule. First, firms appear to view crypto assets more akin to investments than intangible assets, consistent with the rule's mandate of the fair value model. Second, Big 4 auditors steer firms toward the impairment model and less detailed presentation choices. This conservative approach is unlikely to meet the new rule's goal of providing the most decision‐useful information. Third, increased liquidity of crypto markets prompts the use of the fair value model and a more detailed presentation, consistent with the rule's focus on more actively traded tokens. However, within our sample, we find some evidence consistent with fair value reporting increasing stock return volatility and no evidence that it enhances earnings informativeness.</jats:p>",

We find that companies with major shareholders in common with the rating agency (“sister firms”) tend to receive higher ESG ratings. When a company becomes a sister firm through a change in the rating agency's ownership structure, its rating from that agency is subsequently upgraded, whereas its ESG ratings from other agencies remain unchanged. Sister firms exhibit greater rating disagreements across agencies than other firms. The higher ESG ratings for sister firms are partly attributable to the transfer of immaterial positive ESG information through common owners. The common ownership effect is more pronounced when the owner can exert a greater influence on the rating agency. Moreover, sister firms with initially elevated ratings demonstrate poorer future ESG performance. Overall, our findings suggest that owners can affect ESG ratings of their portfolio companies in a way consistent with their influence and interest.</jats:p>",

I rely on the advantages of a laboratory setting to disentangle the interactive element of GenAI from the mere presence of GenAI assistance. Across three experiments, I find that the interactivity underpinning GenAI heightens investors’ self‐assessments of their own abilities and increases their willingness to invest, despite this interactivity not improving, and in fact hindering, their actual processing of information provided by GenAI.

We then provide evidence that informing auditors who inherit an ADA about the test development activities (e.g., a brief memorandum documenting the ADA's development) mitigates the negative effect of inheriting the ADA.

Failing banks are characterized by rising asset losses, deteriorating solvency, and an increasing reliance on expensive noncore funding. These commonalities imply that bank failures are highly predictable using simple accounting metrics from publicly available financial statements. Failures with runs were common before deposit insurance, but these failures are strongly related to weak fundamentals, casting doubt on the importance of non-fundamental runs. Furthermore, low recovery rates on failed banks’ assets suggest that most failed banks subject to runs were fundamentally insolvent, barring large value destruction of receiverships.

Using a regression discontinuity design based on close presidential vote shares, we find that Southern counties where Democrats lost the popular vote between 1880 and 1900 were nearly twice as likely to experience Black lynchings in the following four years. Despite no corresponding changes in local office holding, these defeats were salient among local elites. We show that Southern newspapers, closely aligned with the Democratic Party, amplified narratives of Black criminality in the aftermath of Democratic losses. Such accusations were, in turn, frequently invoked by lynch mobs. These findings point to the strategic use of racial violence by Democratic elites, foreshadowing the institutionalized vote suppression of Jim Crow.</jats:p>",

They respond faster to postpanic stabilization efforts and negative bank-specific information, and are twice as likely to close accounts before failure, passing expected losses to Black depositors, who were the bank’s primary philanthropic target. Our results show how demand deposit funding of bank-like institutions can create systemic disadvantages for less experienced borrowers.</jats:p>",

We find that 40% of these disclosures omit or de‐emphasize information regarding advisers' operational and investment risks when compared to other sources of public information. Funds with such “inconsistencies” are associated with predictably lower fund performance but do not differ in their fund flows, flow‐performance relation, ownership structure, or management fees. These results are consistent with investors being subject to limited strategic thinking, which prevents them from fully unraveling the implications of strategic omissions. This, in turn, contributes to advisers' successful use of discretion to de‐emphasize information with adverse performance implications. Our findings suggest that information processing frictions can facilitate nondisclosure, even in markets with sophisticated investors.</jats:p>",

We find imperfect competition in both markets generates a total wage markdown of more than 30 percent and a total price markup of around 45 percent.

We model a college that bears disutility when it makes admission decisions that “society” dislikes.

Using U.S. airline data, we estimate a dynamic game of competition between heterogeneous firms in an oligopolistic market, with managers incentivized by RPE contracts. While RPE can induce a firm to compete more intensely by smoothing compensation, it also amplifies a firm’s cost efficiency relative to its peers and can weaken competition from inefficient firms. The first effect dominates in small markets and the second in median-sized markets. RPE has little effect in large, highly profitable markets.</jats:p>",

The PMS and the controllability principle are conceptualized as “epistemic objects” (open, question-generating, and complex objects) which are associated with varying stakeholder desires. The paper makes two contributions. First, it demonstrates how a PMS can oscillate between different interpretations of the controllability principle (narrow versus broad), resulting in different controllability boundaries (tight versus loose). Second, the paper theorizes how multiple epistemic objects are formed into combination structures (a combination of epistemic objects that are subsequently codeveloped). Three sequentially developed combination structures of the controllability principle and the PMS, along with their associated effects, are reported. The paper demonstrates how combination structures can, ironically, become antithetical to the desires that set change in motion, and in this case, render the PMS incapable of measuring performance on complex environmental and societal challenges.</jats:p>",

Further, our evidence implies that the debt pricing impact of SEC investigations is amplified for borrowers suffering worse credit quality and information asymmetry as well as those relying more on bank loans. These findings suggest that banks perceive increased risk for borrowers under SEC scrutiny while also leveraging their knowledge of the investigations to extract rents. Supplemental analyses reveal tighter nonspread loan terms and a higher likelihood of amending existing loan contracts during SEC investigations. Additionally, the tightening of loan terms reverses for investigations that conclude without enforcement actions. Overall, our research identifies an economic cost of SEC investigations and alerts regulators to these costs when deciding whether to launch an investigation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Data Availability: All data used are available from the sources indicated in the paper.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>JEL Classifications: M41; D82; G21; K22.</jats:p>",

A structural model calibrated to match our empirical results shows that while credit lines increase total bank credit in bad times, they redistribute credit from firms with high propensities to invest to firms with low propensities to invest, exacerbating the decrease in aggregate investment.</jats:p>",

Through contagion, banks not directly exposed to the attack experienced a liquidity shortfall, causing them to borrow funds or tap reserves. The ability to send payments after hours helped avoid further contagion. These results highlight the importance of preparedness by the private and official sector for cyberattacks.</jats:p>",

Using the universe of published opinions in U.S. Circuit Courts and 1 million District Court criminal sentencing decisions, we estimate the within-judge effect of Manne program attendance. Selection into attendance was limited, as the program was popular among judges of all backgrounds, frequently oversubscribed, and admitted participants on a first-come, first-served basis. We find that after attending economics training, participating judges use more economics language in their opinions, rule against regulatory agencies more often, and impose more severe criminal sentences. We argue that economics, as a rigorous social science, was especially effective in persuading judges.</jats:p>",

Migration disrupts traditional elderly support structures, in which sons live near their parents and care for them in old age. We develop a model in which dowry can promote migration by allowing sons to make upfront transfers to their parents and ease constraints on income sharing. To test this hypothesis, we collect two new data sets that measure the distribution of dowry between family members. We document for the first time that net transfers of dowry to a man’s parents are common but far from universal. Consistent with using dowry for income sharing, such transfers occur more often when sons migrate, especially when they work in higher-earning occupations. In nationally representative data, migration rates are higher in areas with stronger historical dowry traditions. Finally, exploiting a large-scale highway construction program, we show that men from areas with stronger historical dowry traditions migrate more when migration costs fall. Our findings provide some clues as to why dowry persists despite its well-documented adverse consequences.</jats:p>",

We find that candidates move to the center in ideology and rhetorical complexity between the first round (or primary) and the second round (or general election). This convergence reflects candidates’ strategic adjustment to their opponents, as predicted by Downsian competition: Using an RDD we show that candidates converge to the platform of opponents who narrowly qualified for the last round as opposed to those who narrowly failed to qualify.

We cross-randomized additional interventions to address inefficiencies that might depress demand for free contraception, specifically misperceptions about the child mortality rate and social norms. Free contraception did not significantly influence fertility even in combination with these interventions. (JEL D12, J13, J16, J18, O12) </jats:p>",

Exploiting a differential tax credit rate change by firm size in the German manufacturing sector, I find that lowering a firm's investment cost by 7.6 percent increases its capital stock by 17.7 percent and employment by 12.0 percent. Positive local spillovers generate one additional manufacturing job for each directly created job, are strongest between firms in industries connected through input-output linkages, and arise within distances of five kilometers. Firms dependent on local consumer demand also increase employment, while within-industry spillovers generate small negative effects. (JEL D22, H25, H32, J23, L25, L60, R11) </jats:p>",

In this paper, we develop robustness measures that quantify the extent to which the true demand curve must deviate from common functional form assumptions in order to overturn a welfare conclusion. We parametrize this variability in terms of the gradient and curvature of the demand curve. By leveraging tools from information design, we show that our measures are easy to compute. Our measures are also flexible and easy to use, as we illustrate through empirical applications. (JEL D01, D60, F13, H55, Q48) </jats:p>",

Employer effects help explain these income gradients, so equalizing employer effects on claiming would increase the progressivity of UI. Finally, the main source of targeting error in UI is that eligible workers do not claim. (JEL J22, J31, J63, J64, J65) </jats:p>",

We study Chicago Public Schools’ adoption of RP and find that suspensions and arrests decreased, driven by effects for Black students. We find null effects on test score value added, ruling out meaningful average declines.

Specifically, the effect is mitigated when other parties involved in the IPO reduce information risk themselves and when institutional investors are less likely to rely on audited financial information.

We use novel data to measure how audit-employee turnover within individual offices of accounting firms explains the auditor’s ability to deliver for their clients and shapes the auditor-client relationship. We document that audit-employee turnover hampers the auditor’s ability to deliver the audit and leads to auditor realignment. Specifically, audit-employee turnover is associated with costlier, less timely, and less thorough audits that are of lower quality, which damage auditor-client relationships and lead to greater auditor switching and clients selecting auditors with lower turnover. We find that the presence of other strains to the auditor-client relationship exacerbates turnover’s link with auditor realignment.

First, I provide evidence consistent with a proprietary costs channel. Conditional on a set of labor demand characteristics, private firms and redacting firms write shorter postings (i.e., less contextual specificity), and postings are more often anonymous in high-secrecy industries. Then, I exploit the implementation of federal trade secrecy protections as a shock to both innovation and opacity incentives to assess the balance between the two channels. After implementation, firms demand higher skill levels for innovative jobs, consistent with protections spurring innovation. However, contextual specificity decreases, in line with the proprietary costs channel, as protections are maximized when firms remain opaque regarding innovation.

To mitigate endogeneity, we employ instrumental-variable methods, leveraging the staggered implementation of prudent investor rules and enforceability of noncompete agreements.

We find that auditors and clients share a view that they cocreate audits as they each contribute and combine competencies. Coproduction redresses information asymmetries, which enables PS. Although auditor-client relationships (ACRs) facilitate coproduction through reciprocity and trust, coproduction fosters conditions where auditors must balance exercising skeptical judgments and actions and abdicating professional responsibilities that result in impaired PS.

This suggests that research needs an ex ante method for evaluating q2, grounded empirically in the wisdom of the crowd across many different presentations, rather than relying solely on the idiosyncratic assessments of individual researchers. Using fuzzy set theory, we develop such a method that researchers can use to characterize q2 = 0.100, for example, as mostly good fit, leaning toward acceptable.

I find that the standard prompts lease-intensive firms to significantly increase their internal accounting hiring, which enhances lease-related financial reporting quality. Moreover, firms that increased accounting hiring achieve greater efficiency in managing leases than those that implemented the standard without such hiring. This efficiency gain is incremental to improvements from concurrent information system upgrades and is more pronounced in firms with greater cost-saving opportunities and those that hire more experienced accountants. These results highlight that the benefits of internal accounting hiring extend beyond financial reporting, improving firms’ operational decisions.</jats:p>",

This CFA index has predictive power beyond that of the Gilchrist-Zakrajsek credit spread, aggregate earnings, and other macroeconomic indicators in predicting future GDP in both in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting tests. Impulse responses from a structural vector autoregression show that unexpected decreases in this CFA index lead to a large and persistent contraction in economic activity for up to four quarters.

The analysis characterizes the optimal precision of ESG disclosure that channels investors’ tastes for ESG into firm investment. Although it is tempting to think that the optimal ESG disclosure becomes more precise when investors care more about ESG, I show this intuition is incomplete because it overlooks the fact that stronger tastes for ESG change how investors use information. Applying the analysis to a large economy, I show that mandating more precise climate disclosure than would be voluntarily provided motivates self-interested firms to act on common interests in reducing emissions. That is, a regulator can leverage market forces and a disclosure mandate to achieve a similar result as a Pigovian tax in motivating firms to internalize the externalities created by their climate-related investments.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>JEL Classifications: D82; G14; M41.</jats:p>",

This effect is more pronounced when the strategic value of the disclosed information is higher and when DSMs face fewer barriers to sharing information. Additionally, the decline in their human capital value is reflected in a diminished role in transferring timely information about technological innovations.

Despite a presumption of competition among smaller accounting firms, little evidence exists regarding whether and how competition influences audit pricing and quality among them. Additionally, within this market, prior research typically considers competition only from audit offices already serving public-company clients. This study uses a unique database with office-level data for all audit firms in the U.S., regardless of whether they audit public companies, to examine the role of potential entrants. Examining both incumbent threats (offices without public clients but affiliated with a firm serving public clients) and external threats (offices of PCAOB-registered audit firms with no public clients) as sources of competition, the findings suggest that potential entrants are associated with improvements in audit quality and reductions in audit fees for clients of triennially inspected auditors.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Data Availability: Data are available from the sources identified in the paper.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>JEL Classifications: M41; M42; D40; R32.</jats:p>",

Through 30 in-depth interviews and generational theory, the findings suggest that older generations, beneficiaries of workplace access under communism, tend to ignore or adapt to gendered norms in the workplace, follow informal seniority and hierarchy rules, and embrace a “hard worker” identity. Conversely, younger generations, shaped by the one-child policy and participation in a global profession, appear to recognize and resist gender-related norms, view seniority rules as “redundant and bureaucratic,” and prioritize work-life balance. The study also reveals intergenerational dynamics, highlighting the ongoing struggles between women accountants’ social gender roles and professional identity. These insights offer a nuanced understanding of women in accounting, addressing gender in professional accounting settings in China and beyond.</jats:p>",

A rising market prompts investors to recall their past experiences more positively, leading to more optimistic forecasts of future returns.

I bring this “distributional growth accounting” framework to the data by exploiting a new microdatabase representative of nearly all of the world’s population, new estimates of the private returns to schooling, and historical income distribution statistics. Education can account for about 45% of global economic growth and 60% of pretax income growth among the world’s poorest 20% from 1980 to 2019. A significant fraction of these gains was made possible by skill-biased technical change amplifying the returns to education.

We study this question in the Florida hotel industry, as counties in Florida can choose to locally administer the county‐level tourist tax or have the state administer the county‐level tax along with the state‐level tourist tax. Local administration is popular because it supports local employment (of tax administrators) and provides more stringent enforcement on non‐commercial operators (e.g., private rentals). State administration, however, has fewer compliance costs for hotels (e.g., reduced filings and fewer audits). Commentary from the profession suggests the incremental compliance costs of local administration can be considerable.

Treated firms also decrease their investments due to the higher cost of capital. Overall, we document a first-order role for tax incentives that affect the cost of capital in shaping corporate policies. (JEL G31, G32, G38, H25, K34)</jats:p>",

Small banks are relatively more exposed to small business shocks, because small businesses compose a larger share of their customers. Lower real-side demand for small business financial services is responsible for part of the relative decline in small banks’ deposits. Rough calculations suggest that deposits at small banks would have been $280 billion higher from 2002 to 2017 if small firms had grown at the rate of larger firms.</jats:p>",

We estimate that the ETF tax efficiency has increased long-term investors’ after-tax returns by 1.05% per year relative to mutual funds in recent years. Exploiting cross-sectional and time-series variations in investors’ tax burden, we show that tax efficiency is a significant driver of capital migration by high-net-worth investors from mutual funds into ETFs.</jats:p>",

We posit that companies relying on H‐1B visas to hire workers in accounting roles have an increased ability to misreport their financial statements due to the greater costs H‐1B employees face if they are unexpectedly fired for not following the demands of their bosses or for blowing the whistle on misconduct. Using the sharp reduction in the H‐1B visa cap in 2004 as a shock to such employment, we find that companies that relied on this visa program for accounting roles pre‐shock experience a 2.3 percentage point decline in accounting irregularities post‐shock. Cross‐sectional tests show that the reduction in irregularities is greater in companies where H‐1B employees have (1) a greater influence on financial reporting or (2) fewer job opportunities. In addition, the relation between H‐1B visa use and irregularities is stronger in companies whose investors are more focused on near‐term earnings targets. We corroborate our findings using the outcome of H‐1B visa lotteries as shocks to such employment.</jats:p>",

Although organizations often rely on peer evaluations for incentive compensation, it is not well understood how peer feedback should be used and designed to ensure non‐distorted evaluations and motivate effort provision. We study peer evaluations in form of bonus allocation proposals, thereby enabling a quantifiable test of our hypothesis. We distinguish between discretionary use (i.e., allocation by the manager) and formulaic use (i.e., allocation by the team via the average) of self‐including and self‐excluding proposals. We find that, relative to self‐including proposals, self‐excluding proposals are less distorted, irrespective of use, but lead to more effort provision only under formulaic use. Under discretionary use, the benefits of self‐excluding proposals are offset, as managerial biases enter bonus allocations. In sum, our findings illustrate benefits of delegating bonus allocations to teams through formulaic use of self‐excluding peer evaluations and extend the understanding of how organizations can effectively incorporate peer evaluations into incentive compensation.</jats:p>",

Using global data over three decades, we show that dollar appreciation increases import prices and decreases import quantities for non-U.S. dollar countries. In line with a financial channel, these effects are stronger when the exporting country borrows more in U.S. dollars abroad. The financial channel was active before the global financial crisis, has strengthened since, and operates independently of the dominant currency invoicing channel. Instrumenting the dollar is key to uncovering the full effect of the financial channel.</jats:p>",

This article develops a theory of international capital allocation: a multi-country dynamic spatial general equilibrium model in which the entire network of cross-border investment is endogenously determined. Our model features cross-country heterogeneity in fundamental risk, a demand system for international assets, and frictions that cause segmentation in international capital markets. We measure frictions affecting international investment and apply our model to data from nearly 100 countries, using a new dataset of international capital taxes and cultural, linguistic, and geographic distances between countries (geopoliticaldistance.org). Our model performs well in reproducing the composition of international portfolios, the cross section of home bias and rates of return to capital, and other key features of international capital markets. Finally, we carry out counterfactual exercises: we show that barriers to international investment reduce world output by 7% and raise the cross-country dispersion of capital per employee, contributing in a meaningful way to global inequality.</jats:p>",

We exploit the entry of Sustainalytics as a new ESG rating agency in 2010. We conduct a difference‐in‐differences analysis and provide three main findings. First, we find that higher competition decreases incumbents' ESG rating disagreements of the same scope. The negative relation between competition and ESG rating disagreement persists for same‐scope rating metrics not covered by Sustainalytics, suggesting that neither learning nor herding drive the results. The relationship between competition and rating disagreement strengthens for firms with more ESG disclosures, which generally require more effort to analyze. Second, we find that incumbents' ratings of ESG concerns are more strongly associated with future negative ESG news for firms additionally covered by Sustainalytics. This finding is consistent with competition improving ratings' ability to predict future negative ESG incidents. Third, we find that incumbents evaluate more difficult‐to‐measure outcome metrics for firms covered by Sustainalytics, consistent with competition inducing more effort. Overall, our findings suggest that competition serves as an implicit disciplining mechanism of ESG rating agencies' quality.</jats:p>",

We quantify the model’s ability to reproduce salient features of the cyclical properties of measured markups in French administrative firm-level data from the bottom (firm) level to the aggregate level. We document that (i) firm-level markups rise with market share and sector-level markups with concentration, (ii) the relationship between markups and sectoral output varies by firm size—negative for small firms but positive for large ones, (iii) sector-level markups move positively with sectoral output, and (iv) sectoral markups show no systematic relationship with aggregate output. Our model helps rationalize these seemingly conflicting patterns of markup cyclicality in the data.</jats:p>",

However, managers also frequently interact with unfavorable analysts, and this study examines the determinants and benefits of these interactions. I find that managers interact more with unfavorable analysts when compelled to do so. I then examine two likely benefits of these interactions. First, unfavorable analysts attenuate their negative views after interacting with managers. Second, price reactions to management forecasts are stronger for managers who regularly interact with unfavorable analysts, consistent with enhanced reporting credibility. Finally, using peer firm restatements as exogenous shocks to investors’ perceptions of accounting quality, I find that nonrestating firms with managers who regularly interact with unfavorable analysts experience attenuated negative returns relative to other nonrestating peers. Overall, the empirical evidence indicates firms experience significant benefits when managers interact with unfavorable analysts and these benefits persist amongst compelled and voluntary interactions.</jats:p>",

We combine estimated impulse response functions with micro-data on household consumption bundles, asset holdings, and labor income for different U.S. households. We find that inflationary oil shocks are regressive, but monetary expansions are progressive, and there is substantial heterogeneity throughout the life cycle. In all cases, the dominant channel is the effect of the shock on the cost of accumulating assets, not movements in goods prices or labor income.</jats:p>",

We conduct a large-scale field experiment with a near universe of U.S. schools to investigate a potential source of inequality: external demands for parental involvement. Schools receive an email from a fictitious two-parent household and are asked to call one of the parents back. Mothers are 1.4 times more likely than fathers to be contacted. We decompose this inequality and demonstrate that the gender gap in external demands is associated with various measures of gender norms. We also show that signaling a father’s availability substantially changes the gender pattern of callbacks. Our findings underscore a process through which agents outside the household contribute to within-household gender inequalities.</jats:p>",

We exploit a regulatory change that incentivizes deposit collection at the Freedman’s Savings Bank, the first institution to collect deposits from African Americans post-Emancipation, by facilitating misuse of depositor funds. After deregulation, advertising volume rises, particularly in African American newspapers, leading to increased deposits from Black depositors despite the bank’s insolvency. We identify persuasion as a key mechanism; prescriptive stereotypes and false claims likely amplify advertising’s impact on African Americans, exacerbating historically large depositor losses after the bank’s collapse.</jats:p>",
