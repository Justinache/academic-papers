      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: One of the most critical problems in the safe management of healthcare wastes is using different methods in decentralized centers in Iran. This study aimed to compare and prioritize different methods of collection and decontamination of healthcare waste in decentralized health centers in Iran. Methods: In this descriptive-analytical research, we studied various methods of collecting and decontaminating the healthcare waste of decentralized healthcare centers in Iran in terms of administrative, health, economic and environmental. Also, the opinions and the preferences of experts for selecting each method were collected and analyzed. Results: According to environmental health experts, health issues had the highest priority for decontamination of waste from decentralized health centers. Waste collection by special vehicles with the help of the private sector and transfer to centralized disinfection centers is the best method of collecting waste (33%). Also, decontamination by autoclave was the most desirable method (56%) of decontamination. According to the experts’ opinions, landfilling is the most harmful, and autoclave/hydroclave is the least harmful method to the climate and soil. Based on the environmental health experts, the health aspect was the most important priority in waste management of decentralized healthcare centers (54%). Conclusion: The most appropriate way to decontaminate this type of waste is autoclaving after collection at a centralized location. It is suggested that further studies be conducted on modern collection and disinfection systems along with localization and determination of workplace health policies.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to investigate the performance of enhanced modified Ludzack Ettinger process-oxic settling anaerobic (MLE-OSA) process for treating real municipal wastewater in Sari wastewater Treatment, Sari City, Iran. Methods: To combine the OSA process technique with the MLE system, the Sludge Holding Tanks (SHT) were implemented in the return sludge line of designed pilot studies which comprised 1) MLE, which was regarded as the control system similar; 2) MLE-OSA4 with a 70-L SHT operated at 4-h Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT), and 3) MLEOSA6 with a 107-L SHT operated at 6-h HRT. To start the process, the overflow effluent of the primary settling tank of the Sari wastewater treatment plant was used. After 45-60 days, the reactors reached a steady state. The parameters of Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP), temperature, pH, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and nutrients were analyzed. Results: The results revealed that the average TSS, COD, BOD, phosphorus, nitrite, nitrate, and total nitrogen in MLEOSA4 effluent decreased 20.1, 14.6, 2.97, 10, 51.1, 19.3, and 20.7%, respectively compared to MLE. Similarly, in MLE-OSA6, the values decreased 34.2, 16.1, 14.6, 16.7, 69.6, 31.3, and 25.8%, respectively compared to the control process. Conclusion: Therefore, using natural wastewater, the enhanced MLE-OSA process showed better performance in removing the study parameters and better quality for the effluent. Furthermore, the quality of effluent is following the Iran Department of Environment (IDE).</jats:p>",

This research was done to investigate the effect of drought stress, soil salinity, Piriformospora indica (P. indica), and MWCNs on biodegradation of diesel oil in the soil that contaminated with Pb and Cd under cultivation of triticale plant. Methods: Treatments consisted of applying MWCNs (2% [W/W]) in the Pb- and Cd-polluted soil that was simultaneously polluted with diesel oil (0, 5, and 10% [W/W]), and the plants used in this study were inoculated with P. indica. After 70 days, plants were harvested, and plant and soil Cd were measured using AAS (atomic absorption spectrometry). In addition, the degradation percentage of diesel oil in soil was determined. Results: Soil application of MWCNs at the rate of 2% (W/W) significantly increased the biodegradation of diesel oil in the soil in the drought and salinity (6 dS/m) stress by 11.3% and 15.6%, respectively. In addition, plant inoculation with P. indica significantly increased the biodegradation of diesel oil in the soil by 12.3%. For salinity (6 dS/m) and drought stress, it was increased by 8.3% and 9.4%, respectively. In addition, the Pb and Cd concentrations decreased by 14.3% and 12.8%, respectively, when the MWCNs were added to the soil (2% [W/W]). Conclusion: Soil application of MWCNs and plant inoculation with P. indica not only increased the biodegradation of diesel oil but also decreased the plant Pb and Cd concentrations.</jats:p>",

Methods: In June 2016, a total of 30 toxic element samples were taken from surface soils to examine their contents of lead (Pb), Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), Nickel (Ni), Arsenic (As), Chromium (Cr), and Cadmium (Cd). The samples were collected from 0 to 20 cm depth and measured using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) (PG990 Model). Results: The results showed that the mean concentrations of all toxic elements except arsenic had a higher value than the background values in the world. The Top Enrichment Factor (TEF) of toxic elements of nickel, chromium, lead, and copper was higher than other elements. The Potential Ecological Risk (PER) index showed high and very high risk for the elements. For all elements, the Hazard Index (HI) values were higher for children than for adults. Moreover, the results of carcinogenic health risk assessment (Carcinogenicity Risk [CR]) of the toxic elements for Cr in children with an average value of 0.001 and adults with an average value of 3.81e-04 showed that the CR of chromium for children poses a serious threat to the health of children and adults. Conclusion: In general, the toxic element pollution for the surface soil of Arak is of concern, and significant measures should be taken to reduce the pollutants.</jats:p>",

Creating the proper performance measurement systems in every organization has had a promising interest in university studies, and many researchers are working on it. Methods: This research intends to compare and rank 4 evaluation performance models used in gas refineries. To achieve the desired model in this study, we employed the grounded theory. The study research consisted of 20 professionals and Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) managers of gas refineries who had relevant experience and skills in this area. The normal score was estimated based on the weight obtained from the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to apply the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) process and prioritize the models. Results: The pairwise comparison matrix of 4 research models of the balanced scoring card, European foundation for quality management business excellence model, Iran national quality award, and environmental performance evaluation depicted that the geometric mean of the evaluation criteria includes the following items: the capability to quantify qualitative data for environmental performance, facilitating, efficient implementing, structuring, and mapping a roadmap of organization maturity to select an environmental performance estimated at 1.22, 0.90, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively. Also, the normal weights of these four criteria are estimated at 0.3039423, 0.2242449, 0.2347026, and 0.2371102, respectively. Conclusion: The findings resulting from prioritizing the organization’s Environmental Performance Evaluation (EPE) models based on TOPSIS depicted that the suggested model with relative proximity to 99% is the first choice of EPE for the gas refinery.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Visible light of short wavelength (blue light) can damage the retina cells, called blue light hazard. To protect the retina, permissible exposure limits have been determined by ICNIRP (the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection) and other health and safety agencies. These limits include complex physical concepts, and their evaluation requires light measuring instruments equipped with a blue light hazard function filter, which is not available at the moment in developing countries. This study aims to assess retinal blue light hazard using the correlated color temperature of Light-Emitting Diode (LED) light sources. Methods: In this study, a new method was proposed for evaluating the retinal blue light hazard using only the Correlated Color Temperature (CCL) of LED light sources for which concern on blue light hazard has currently been reinforced. In the proposed method, the radiometric quantity (blue light effective radiance) in W.m-2.sr-1 was converted to the corresponding photometric quantity (blue light effective luminance) in lm.m-2.sr-1. Then a computer code was developed for relevant calculations. Results: The estimated permissible exposure times applying the new photometry approach were highly reliable and supported by the literature. The proposed method is particularly useful because it eliminates the need to utilize any light measuring device. Conclusion: The new approach makes the concept of blue light hazard straightforward and understandable for all specialists dealing with optical radiation safety.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: This study aimed to investigate the concentrations of heavy metals bound to airborne Particulate Matter (PM) in high-traffic districts of Tehran, Iran, and to determine the carcinogenic risk and Hazard Quotient (HQ) of these metals using a descriptive-applied method. Methods: Six indoor/outdoor stations were established in three high-traffic districts of Tehran. Each station was sampled with six replicates in winter 2018 (36 samples in total). After extracting the metals from fiberglass filters by acid digestion based on the ASTM (the American Society for Testing and Materials method), the concentrations of heavy metals were determined by an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP-OES) device. The human health risk was evaluated according to the US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) standard method. The obtained data were analyzed by the Spearman correlation and Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) in SPSS. Results: Districts 2, 3, and then 15 were the most high-traffic areas of Tehran in descending order. Average heavy metal concentrations were detected in order of Al&gt;Fe&gt;Pb&gt;Mn&gt;Cu&gt;Zn&gt;Cr&gt;As&gt;Ni&gt;Cd. Also, the heavy metals concentrations were significantly different between indoor and outdoor environments. The correlations between heavy metal concentrations, carcinogenic risk, and HQ were significant in all three districts (P&lt;0.05). Mean carcinogenic risk variables, HQ levels, and heavy metal concentrations in all three regions were in order of districts 15&gt;2&gt;3 and outdoors&gt;indoors. Conclusion: Based on the results, serious measures are recommended to control traffic congestion in Tehran to prevent cancer risk and other health hazards caused by heavy metal bonded TSP (total suspended particulate matter).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Investigating human health during work importantly affect the safety and efficiency of the society. Different types of activity, including industrial, constructional, heavy duty ones, etc., affect the health of workers during their activities. In this study, the Multi-Objective Decision-Making (MODM) method was combined with fuzzy TOPSIS to investigate and optimize the air pollution risk affecting the health and safety of construction workers of Lar City, Fars Province, Iran. Methods: The comparison matrices (binary) and the Phillips–Perron test of different criteria and sub-criteria of health risk, including safety view, safety efficiency, understanding the risk, and risk investigation, were assessed to find the most influential factors for the optimization of the health risk of the workers. Results: Accordingly, the results indicated that “understanding the risk” followed by “safety efficiency” affected the health risk of the construction workers the most. However, among the sub-criteria, the most effective ones were “worker knowledge”, “manager knowledge”, “logistic specialized managers”, “modern facilities”, and “modern technology”. The selection of the linear and non-linear models was conducted according to the F values, and the model parameters were estimated using the Newton-Raphson test. Most coefficients were significant at P= 0.99. The model also has a high describing value of 0.97. The final estimated homogeneity coefficient was equal to 1.31, and it ranged from 0.86 to 2.72 for the critical risk investigation. The significance of the present research is to increase the health and safety of workers during work resulting in a more sustainable and healthier environment. Conclusion: Accordingly, the managers could handle the risks, determine the tolerable risks, indicate the risk of each process to control expenses, and take the essential measures for optimization.</jats:p>",

The present study aimed to assess the effects of relaxing music on life distress and Maternal-Fetal Attachment (MFA) in pregnant women. Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study with a pre-test, post-test and a control group design. The research population included all Iranian pregnant women referring to Laleh Hospital in Tehran City, Iran, in 2020. In total, 30 women were selected using the convenience sampling method and randomly assigned into the intervention and control groups (n=15/group). The required data were collected using the Life Distress Inventory (LDI) and the Maternal-Fetal Attachment Scale (MFAS). The intervention group listened to relaxing music for twelve 45-50-minute sessions in the morning and during routine midwifery visits; however, the controls received no intervention. The collected data were analyzed using Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) in SPSS V. 22. Results: The obtained results indicated that the intervention group reported a lower level of life distress in the post-test, compared to the controls (P=0.0001, F=15.860). The intervention group also achieved a higher mean score on MFA, than the control group (P=0.0001, F=35.872).  Conclusion: According to the present research findings, reproductive health, nursing professionals, and psychologists could recommend music as a complementary therapy to reduce stress and distress experienced by expecting mothers and to improve MFA.</jats:p>",

Metode yang digunakan adalah Systematic Literature Review (SLR) dengan mengumpulkan artikel-artikel yang relevan dari tahun 2018 hingga 2025, yang mengkaji tren dan strategi dalam konteks pembelajaran ukuran pemusatan data. Artikel-artikel yang relevan dikumpulkan dari berbagai basis data akademik terkemuka, seperti Scopus dan Google Scholar, dengan menggunakan kata kunci yang berkaitan dengan Realistic Mathematics Education (RME), Project Based Learning (PjBL), dan ukuran pemusatan data. Proses seleksi inklusi dilakukan dengan menyaring 1383 artikel yang relevan menjadi 175 artikel, dan setelah pemeriksaan lebih lanjut, 147 artikel dieliminasi berdasarkan kriteria relevansi. Akhirnya, 15 artikel dipilih untuk analisis lebih lanjut. Hasil utama penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa RME dan PjBL menjadi dua pendekatan yang semakin populer dari tahun 2018 hingga 2025 dalam pengajaran ukuran pemusatan di kalangan peneliti, dengan strategi penggunaan konteks dunia nyata, proyek berbasis pembelajaran, dan integrasi teknologi dan etnomatematika dalam mendukung kemampuan berpikir kritis siswa.</jats:p>",

En s’appuyant sur les travaux examinant la complémentarité entre hard et soft law , notre étude se propose d’éclairer la manière dont l’implication des pouvoirs publics dans l’encadrement des acteurs privés influence leur perception du rôle instrumental de la communication RSE. À partir de données recueillies auprès d’un échantillon d’entreprises internationales totalisant 11743 observations couvrant 30 pays entre 2007 et 2018, notre analyse empirique montre que la relation entre la communication de l’information RSE et la performance financière des entreprises apparaît plus significative dans les pays caractérisés par une faible efficacité des pouvoirs publics et un État de droit plus fort. Nos résultats indiquent que la perception des acteurs privés d'un faible leadership de la gouvernance publique est de nature à les inciter à davantage considérer la qualité de l'information RSE comme un levier stratégique de performance dans une logique substitutive de la hard law par la soft law .</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to find out the conflict and termination of employment both partially and simultaneously have a significant effect on the morale of employees at PT. The benefits of Medan Technique and how much it affects. The method used in this research is quantitative method with several tests namely reliability analysis, classical assumption deviation test and linear regression. Based on the results of primary data regression processed using SPSS 20, multiple linear regression equations were obtained as follows: Y = 1,031 + 0.329 X1+ 0.712 X2.In part, the conflict variable (X1)has a significant effect on the employee's work spirit (Y) at PT. Medan Technical Benefits. This means that the hypothesis in this study was accepted, proven from the value of t calculate &gt; t table (3,952 &lt; 2,052). While the variable termination of employment (X2) has a significant influence on the work spirit of employees (Y) in PT. Medan Technical Benefits. This means that the hypothesis in this study was accepted, proven from the value of t calculate &gt; t table (7,681 &gt; 2,052). Simultaneously, variable conflict (X1) and termination of employment (X2) have a significant influence on the morale of employees (Y) in PT. Medan Technical Benefits. This means that the hypothesis in this study was accepted, as evidenced by the calculated F value &gt; F table (221,992 &gt; 3.35). Conflict variables (X1) and termination of employment (X2) were able to contribute an influence on employee morale variables (Y) of 94.3% while the remaining 5.7% was influenced by other variables not studied in this study. From the above conclusions, the author advises that employees and leaders should reduce prolonged conflict so that the spirit of work can increase. Leaders should be more selective in severing employment relationships so that decent employees are not dismissed unilaterally. Employees should work in a high spirit so that the company can see the quality that employees have.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cette étude examine le comportement des analystes financiers face à la gestion des chiffres comptables, en se concentrant sur les offres d'actions secondaires, où une gestion significative à la hausse des résultats financiers est souvent soupçonnée. Les analystes sont classés en deux groupes : ceux qui privilégient l'exactitude (en alignant leurs prévisions sur les résultats déclarés) et ceux qui favorisent l'informativité (en prévoyant les résultats non gérés ou reflétant la véritable performance de l’entreprise). En analysant 1 733 offres d’actions en Europe entre 2000 et 2016, l’étude révèle que les analystes informatifs révisent leurs prévisions à la baisse après l'annonce des offres, tandis que ceux recherchant l'exactitude maintiennent leurs prévisions inchangées. Les analystes informatifs ajustent davantage leurs prévisions pour les entreprises présentant une probabilité accrue de gestion des chiffres comptables, notamment celles avec des accruals discrétionnaires élevés ou des émissions de grande envergure. Les résultats soulignent l'influence des caractéristiques des entreprises et des prévisions sur ces comportements différenciés. Par exemple, les grandes entreprises et celles suivies par de nombreux analystes voient une réduction moins marquée des prévisions informatives, en raison d’une moindre probabilité de gestion des chiffres comptables. Par ailleurs, la directive européenne sur les abus de marché (MAD) a réduit les conflits d'intérêts parmi les analystes affiliés. Cette recherche enrichit la littérature en différenciant les approches des analystes face aux offres d’actions et en offrant une nouvelle perspective sur l’influence de l’informativité dans leurs prévisions, ouvrant ainsi la voie à une meilleure compréhension des comportements des analystes financiers.</jats:p>",

Pendant le Ramadan, la surévaluation perçue des entreprises peut inciter les dirigeants à choisir cette période pour réaliser des acquisitions. Nous constatons que, conformément à l'hypothèse de timing de marché, l'activité cumulée des fusions et acquisitions est plus élevée en moyenne pendant le Ramadan, les dirigeants sont moins susceptibles d'écouter le marché et la performance post-acquisition est plus faible. Des analyses supplémentaires montrent des résultats différents pour les trois principaux pays de fusions et acquisitions de notre échantillon. Les résultats pour la Malaisie témoignent d'une stratégie de timing de marché désavantageuse pendant le Ramadan : pour les transactions annoncées pendant cette période, les dirigeants sont moins susceptibles d'écouter le marché, la probabilité de paiement en actions est plus élevée ainsi que la probabilité d'achèvement de l'opération, et la performance opérationnelle post-fusion est moins bonne. En revanche, il n'y a pas de preuve de timing de marché en Turquie et en Arabie saoudite. Nous sommes amenés à interpréter les résultats pour ces deux derniers pays comme étant cohérents avec le sentiment religieux conduisant à des transactions de meilleure qualité pendant le Ramadan.</jats:p>",

En utilisant un échantillon de 308 sociétés françaises cotées dans l’indice CAC-All Shares de 2002 à 2020, nous constatons que les entreprises familiales sont plus susceptibles de réduire leur empreinte carbone que les entreprises non familiales. Cependant, le comportement carbone des entreprises familiales n’est pas homogène. L’éponymie familiale influence négativement les émissions de carbone. Étonnamment, l’effet du stade générationnel familial est positif, suggérant que les entreprises familiales des premières générations sont plus vertueuses que celles des générations suivantes. Des tests supplémentaires démontrent que la présence des fondateurs en tant que PDG ou président de conseil d’administration est associée à la réduction des émissions carbone. Nous montrons également que l’innovation verte, la présence de l’entreprise dans un secteur polluant, l’Accord de Paris et la loi sur la transition énergétique en 2015 ont renforcé les réductions d’émissions des entreprises familiales. Enfin, nous soutenons que l’engagement à réduire les émissions de carbone est un facteur d’augmentation de la valeur des entreprises familiales.</jats:p>",

La dette tend à augmenter le risque de licenciement des employés et à diminuer leur pouvoir de négociation, alors que la réglementation du travail a les effets inverses. L’hypothèse centrale de l’article est qu’un durcissement de la réglementation du travail induit un effet modérateur de la dette sur les salaires. Nous testons cette hypothèse sur un large échantillon d’entreprises de l’OCDE sur la période 1990-2018 et montrons que la corrélation entre la dette et les salaires est systématiquement plus faible dans les pays où la réglementation du travail est plus protectrice. Une méthodologie de différence de différences empilées (stacked DiD) exploitant les principales réformes du marché du travail sur notre échantillon, démontre la robustesse de nos résultats. Des tests empiriques complémentaires révèlent que nos résultats peuvent s’expliquer tant par le canal de la prime de risque que celui du pouvoir de négociation. Nous montrons aussi qu’un droit des créanciers plus fort, une centralisation plus importante de la fixation des salaires et un pouvoir plus fort des syndicats tend à diminuer l’effet joint de la dette et de la réglementation du travail sur les salaires.</jats:p>",

À partir d’un échantillon de 16 871 nominations dans 43 pays sur la période 2002-2019 (post-loi Sarbanes-Oxley et pré-Covid-19), nous réalisons une étude d’événement qui révèle des variations significatives des réactions boursières selon le pays d’origine des entreprises. En utilisant les dimensions culturelles du projet GLOBE et des analyses de régressions multivariées, nous montrons que la culture nationale influence ces réactions. Plus précisément, dans les cultures collectivistes, orientées vers l’avenir et centrées sur l’humain, les marchés réagissent positivement aux nominations de femmes. Nous soulignons également que le type de poste pour lequel une femme est nommée joue un rôle dans ces réactions. Cette recherche enrichit la littérature sur la diversité de genre dans les instances dirigeantes en offrant une perspective interculturelle sur l’impact du genre des dirigeants sur la réaction des marchés financiers. Elle propose des pistes nouvelles pour les chercheurs et les praticiens en mettant en lumière l’importance des normes, traditions sociales et pratiques culturelles dans l’évaluation des effets de la diversité de genre sur la performance des entreprises.</jats:p>",

Il apparaît clairement que ces investisseurs ont un profil distinct. La probabilité et l’ampleur des investissements dans les P-ETF sont liées à un niveau d’éducation plus élevé et à une plus longue expérience de négociation. Les investisseurs en P-ETF déclarent avoir des connaissances financières plus élevées, un objectif de rendement moins élevé, une tolérance au risque plus faible et un horizon d’investissement plus long. L’excès de confiance est moins présent chez eux et les actions qu’ils détiennent sont moins orientés vers le marché domestique.

L’analyse s’applique à des organisations de microfinance du monde entier. Prenant appui sur la théorie du signal, nous formulons l’hypothèse que le don en tant qu’acte a plus d’impact que le montant donné. En outre, nous établissons l’existence d’un effet d’empreinte ( imprinting effect ) selon lequel les performances sociales persistent même lorsque les dons se tarissent. En d’autres termes, le niveau accru des performances sociales observées au cours des périodes subventionnées se maintient lors des périodes ultérieures non subventionnées. Il s’ensuit que des contributions diversifiées et réparties entre de nombreuses organisations peuvent amener le donateur à atteindre un impact social global supérieur à celui résultant de contributions concentrées sur un petit nombre d’organisations bénéficiaires.</jats:p>",

Our core finding is that vouchers generate long-run welfare gains by reducing inequality and generating skill improvements that offset higher taxation and other GE effects. Although vouchers lead to larger welfare gains on average, we find housing supply. (JEL D63, H24, J13, J24, R23, R31, R38)</jats:p>",

With such externalities to nonusers, standard consumer surplus measures, which take aggregate consumption as given, fail to appropriately capture consumer welfare.

Incentivized experiments with college students indicate positive welfare based on the standard measure but negative welfare when accounting for these nonuser externalities. Our findings high-light the existence of product market traps, where active users of a platform prefer it not to exist. (JEL D62, D83, D91, L82, Z13)</jats:p>",

At the same time, temporary earnings risk declined. Using education and occupation codes, we show that rising persistent earnings risk is concentrated among high-skill workers and related to technology adoption. (JEL J22, J24, J31, J64)</jats:p>",

Using an estimated model of monopsonistic local labor markets, it finds that minimum wage hikes and labor demand shocks drove the decline in Brazilian wage inequality from 1998 to 2012. While rising educational attainment compressed skill premiums within firms, it also reallocated skilled workers to high-wage firms, limiting that shock’s effect on inequality. The analysis highlights interactions among exogenous factors, showing that concurrent supply and demand changes attenuated minimum wage impacts. (JEL J22, J23, J24, J31, J38, J42, R23)</jats:p>",

We develop a unified theoretical framework and empirically show that mutual funds issuing demandable equity also provide an economically significant amount of liquidity by insuring against idiosyncratic liq uidity shocks. Quantitatively, bond funds provide 12.5% of the liquidity that banks provide per dollar. Our model further shows that when equity values incorporate the liquidation cost from re demptions, as in swing pricing, liquidity provision is not necessarily reduced. This is because swing pricing may increase funds’ capacity for holding illiquid assets without inducing panic runs. (JEL G01, G21, G23, G28)</jats:p>",

We find that a one‐standard‐deviation increase in social media sentiment after a merger announcement is associated with a 0.64 percentage point lower probability of withdrawal (16.6% of the average). This effect is unexplained by abnormal price reactions, traditional news, and analyst recommendations. Consistent with manager learning, the informativeness of social media strengthens after firms start corporate Twitter accounts. The informativeness is driven by longer acquisition‐related tweets by fundamental investors, rather than memes and price trend tweets. These findings suggest that social media signals can be important for corporate decisions.</jats:p>",

Controlling for various other factors of executive financial misconduct, we find that executives are significantly more likely to engage in financial misconduct, including accounting, tax, and other financial offenses, if their parents have a history of financial misconduct. This intergenerational association is stronger when the parental misconduct is more severe. Additional findings reveal that growing up in high‐misconduct municipalities and cohabiting with spouses who engage in financial misconduct are also associated with a higher likelihood of executive misconduct, indicating that such behaviors may be shaped by broader socialization processes that extend beyond the immediate family. Although our analyses do not establish causal relationships, the collective evidence presented in this study offers insights into why some corporate executives engage in misconduct while others do not.</jats:p>",

The reactions are also stronger for the fourth fiscal quarter than interim quarters, suggesting that year‐end results garner greater employee attention. Furthermore, consistent with media facilitating employee processing of EA news, the reactions are stronger for EAs covered by a larger number of news articles. Finally, in line with the notion that EAs contain information about employees’ future cash flows, we find that EA news predicts changes in employee wages and that employees with higher past wage‐to‐EA news sensitivity exhibit stronger spending reactions.

Drawing on unsealed records from litigation against Purdue Pharma, we uncover rich geographic variation in the marketing of prescription opioids that serves as a quasi-exogenous source of exposure to the epidemic. We use this variation to document significant increases in drug-related mortality and greater reliance on public transfer programs. This induced economic hardship led to substantial changes in the political landscape of the communities most affected by the opioid epidemic. We estimate that from the mid-2000s to 2022, exposure to the opioid epidemic continuously increased the Republican vote share in House, presidential, and gubernatorial elections. By the 2022 House elections, a one-standard-deviation increase in our measure of exposure led to a 4.5 percentage point increase in the Republican vote share. From 2012 until 2022, this increase in the House vote share translated into Republicans winning additional seats.</jats:p>",

We find that bank stocks experience large, permanent declines at the onset of crises. These losses predict commensurate long-term declines in banks’ earnings and dividends, rather than elevated future equity returns. Bank losses are primarily driven by write-downs of nonperforming assets, not asset sales during panics. Forceful liquidity-based interventions during crises predict only small, temporary increases in bank market value. Overall, these results suggest that bank losses during crises are not primarily due to temporary price dislocations. Early liquidity interventions can avert banking crises, but only under specific conditions.

These findings are explained by stronger banking competition and greater reliance on financial statement data. However, firms do not expand their net financial position, as bank credit substitutes for other liabilities, and exhibit weaker performance consistent with the costs of reporting regulation. This evidence from a different setting offers new insights into how reporting regulation influences credit contracting for private firms and strengthens the empirical basis for policy‐making.</jats:p>",

Using novel data from public hospitals in Chile, we show how the introduction of a competitive recruitment system and better pay for public hospital CEOs reduced hospital mortality by 8 percent. The effect is not explained by a change in patient composition. We find that the policy changed the pool of CEOs by displacing doctors with no management training in favor of CEOs who had studied management. Productivity improvements were driven by hospitals that recruited higher quality CEOs. (JEL D24, G34, I11, I18, J45, M54, O15)</jats:p>",

We find a high slope for the cost-based Phillips curve, which contrasts with the low estimates of the conventional output gap–based formulation found in the literature. We reconcile by showing that the output elasticity of marginal cost is low, at least during moderate inflation periods (e.g., pre-pandemic). (JEL C51, E12, E23, E31, E32, L60)</jats:p>",

Through risk premia, large-scale bond purchases lower domestic and foreign bond yields and depreciate the currency, and short-rate cuts lower foreign yields, with smaller effects than bond purchases. Currency returns are disconnected from long-maturity bond returns, and yet the currency market is instrumental in transmitting bond demand shocks across countries.

In this essay, I discuss my approach to research: developing insights of various types, sharing those insights with diverse audiences, and trying to have a range of different impacts. Along the way, I discuss two “elephants in the room”: (1) our very cautious and conservative research culture, which constrains the insights we can offer; and (2) the emergence of a “Top 6 journals only” decision rule, which constrains the audiences we can reach. I hope that this essay will inspire readers to expand their insights, audiences, and impact, thereby increasing the enjoyment that they derive from an academic accounting career. I also hope that we can work together to address the two elephants in the room.</jats:p>",

Using large cuts in industry-level import tariff rates as a setting, we find that domestic firms respond to a looming competitive threat from foreign rivals by raising cost rigidity. This increase cannot plausibly be explained by investments to create physical excess capacity, suggesting firms enter cost commitments for labor and procurement instead. Additional tests corroborate the hypothesized preemptive intent. First, the increase in cost rigidity is concentrated in industries in which a firm’s aggressive market stance elicits a softening of competition. Second, it is only in these industries that firms with rigid cost structures experience market share gains around a large tariff cut. The latter effect is more pronounced the more reliably firms’ cost structures can be discerned from their financial statements. Overall, our study suggests that firms enter cost commitments as a preemptive strategy.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Data Availability: Data are available from the public sources cited in the text.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>JEL Classifications: L22; M21; M40; M41.</jats:p>",

This study examines whether a common control choice—framing pay raise budgets in percentages—contributes to perpetuating pay gaps. We predict that when the pay raise budget is framed as a percentage (the percentage frame), it inadvertently nudges managers to anchor individual raises on that budget percentage, thereby impounding prior salaries, and thus, existing inequities, into pay raises. We further predict that framing the pay raise budget as an absolute amount (the dollar frame) can un-nudge this behavior. As expected, we find in two experiments that the dollar frame perpetuates pay gaps less than the percentage frame, and that this difference is robust to varying levels of ambiguity about the source of salary differences. Our study examines a simple, cost-effective way to limit the perpetuation of pay gaps.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Data Availability: Contact the authors.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>JEL Classifications: D91; J16; J31; J71; M40; M52.</jats:p>",

Moreover, the misstatement data-generating process is evolving due to regulatory regime shifts, further complicating the evaluation of model predictions. We design an approach that accounts for detection lags and continuously updates models to adapt to the changing data-generating process. By comparing with the conventional approach that ignores detection lags, we show that the look-ahead bias can substantially inflate prediction performance. We also demonstrate that although leaving a temporal gap between training and test samples can mitigate the look-ahead bias, it sacrifices the model’s predictive power by disconnecting the dynamic data-generating process between training and test periods. We further implement a trading strategy to evaluate the practical utility of the continuously updating approach.

Based on the behavioral life-cycle model, we predict payment timing influences how recipients spend government transfers, but that this effect is muted when the transfer payment is combined with other income. In contrast to prior research, our experimental findings provide theory-consistent results and suggest recipients of a periodic transfer spend more of the transfer than recipients of a lump sum transfer, but only when the transfer is standalone and not combined. Our findings help to explain theory-inconsistent results of prior research and extend the literature on the behavioral life-cycle model and mental budgeting. Moreover, our results suggest policymakers can intentionally structure the distribution of government transfers to encourage household spending or saving consistent with policy goals.</jats:p>",

We document that mandatory IFRS adoption is associated with a significantly larger improvement in the quality of analysts’ information environment for U.S. firms with relatively few domestic industry peers than for other U.S. firms. Further, we show that there is a larger increase in the frequency with which analysts’ research reports for U.S. firms with few domestic peers mention IFRS-adopting EU industry peer firms.

Using hand-collected data to capture disclosure quality of CSR reports and intensity of CSR contracting (i.e., scope, importance, and degree to which CSR metrics are incorporated) for S&amp;P 500 firms, we show that firms indeed align the design choices of the two practices.

Children from families in the top 1% are more than twice as likely to attend an Ivy-Plus college as those from middle-class families with comparable SAT/ACT scores. Two-thirds of this gap is due to higher admissions rates for students with comparable test scores from high-income families; the remaining third is due to differences in rates of application and matriculation. In contrast, children from high-income families have no admissions advantage at flagship public colleges. The high-income admissions advantage at Ivy-Plus colleges is driven by three factors: (1) preferences for children of alumni, (2) weight placed on non-academic credentials, and (3) athletic recruitment. Using a new research design that isolates idiosyncratic variation in admissions decisions for waitlisted applicants, we show that attending an Ivy-Plus college instead of the average flagship public college increases students- chances of reaching the top 1% of the earnings distribution by 50%, nearly doubles their chances of attending an elite graduate school, and almost triples their chances of working at a prestigious firm. The three factors that give children from high-income families an admissions advantage are uncorrelated or negatively correlated with post-college outcomes, whereas academic credentials such as SAT/ACT scores are highly predictive of post-college success.</jats:p>",

Survey responses from nearly 10,000 full-time workers indicate that most workers provide their salary expectations before they receive a job offer. Most outside offers are rejected, with the worker remaining at the incumbent firm.

GDP losses following crises are economically significant and are larger for wealthier countries, with some evidence that these losses are mitigated by democratic political systems and liberal currency regimes. Finally, intervention frequencies reached an apex during the post–Bretton Woods era, continuing a secular increase since at least the late seventeenth century.</jats:p>",

Cities more dependent on land sales and land-backed debt before the pandemic experienced greater price increases and price–volume divergence, with LGFVs buying more land at higher prices than other buyers.

Our analysis draws on administrative data from a Chinese university covering three student cohorts over four years. We exploit random roommate assignments, differential exposure to a policy shock (gaming restrictions for minors), and differential exposure to a discrete event (the introduction of a blockbuster video game) for identification. App usage is contagious: a one s.d. increase in roommates’ in-college app usage raises own usage by 5.8%. High app usage is harmful across all measured outcomes. A one s.d. increase in app usage reduces GPAs by 36.2% of a within-cohort-major s.d. and lowers wages by 2.3%. Roommates’ app usage reduces a student’s GPAs and wages through both disruptions and behavioral spillovers, generating a total negative effect that exceeds half the magnitude of the impact from the student’s own app usage. Extending China’s three-hour-per-week gaming restriction for minors to college students would boost their initial wages by 0.9%. High-frequency GPS and app usage data show that heavy app users spend less time in study halls, are more frequently late or absent from class, and get less sleep.</jats:p>",

We also find that monitors with targeted accounting oversight responsibilities are associated with improved corporate culture, a higher likelihood of financial restatements during their tenure, and enhanced financial reporting credibility at the firms they oversee relative to enforcement firms without such monitors.

However, individuals may hesitate to rely on algorithmic output, particularly under conditions of uncertainty. We conduct two experiments examining whether and how a system’s ability to adapt—an emerging feature of machine learning—interacts with uncertainty to influence accounting professionals’ reliance on algorithmic advice. In Experiment 1, we find that auditors are more willing to rely on advice from learning algorithms than static algorithms when estimation uncertainty is relatively high. Experiment 2 replicates this result in a general accounting context where preparers develop their own estimates. Our findings demonstrate that accounting professionals’ reliance on algorithms is contextually dependent, and highlights algorithm adaptability as an important technological feature that can promote advice utilization, particularly when adaptability is likely important to the judgment context (e.g., when estimation uncertainty is high).</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>JEL Classifications: M40; M41; M42; O30; O32; O33.</jats:p>",

In sum, my opinion is that the future is bright and full of opportunities for tax scholars. Governments are altering corporate income tax laws in fundamental ways and questions about how these changes affect investment, investment location, income shifting, corporate capital structure, and financial reporting will be very important aspects to study. New and newly used taxes, such as tariffs and endowment taxes, will allow for novel paths of inquiry and accountants should contribute. The use of AI by tax authorities and taxpayers could alter both tax enforcement and tax planning. The increasing access to administrative data, the use of field experiments and field studies, and employing survey methods to obtain data should expand the settings available to study and improve identification.</jats:p>",

Tests examining multiple analysts forecasting on the same focal firm at the same time find that individual analysts overweight idiosyncratic local news and underweight news from economically linked firms that are not in their coverage portfolios. Market prices track the analyst bias from local news, leading to predictable and economically significant return reversal patterns in the future.

Specifically, secondees bridge gaps in the GNF structure by brokering network ties, technical knowledge, sociocultural knowledge, and language. Secondees embody different brokerage roles and can fulfill more than one brokerage role at a time, depending on the purpose of the secondment and the stage of deployment. Collectively, secondments are important mechanisms by which structural holes are reduced between participating member firms and proximal member firms, ultimately benefiting the global firm and the global clients they serve.</jats:p>",

The MCDC granted favorable settlement terms to municipal debt issuers and underwriters who voluntarily self-reported having violated SEC disclosure requirements. Although underwriters participated widely, most municipal issuers did not participate in the MCDC initiative despite having publicly observable disclosure violations. We find that, after the MCDC, official statements were less likely to contain false claims about past compliance—particularly when underwriters had participated—suggesting improved underwriter oversight of the initial bond offering. However, contrary to the SEC’s intention, we observe a 9 percent post-MCDC decrease in issuers’ compliance with continuing disclosure requirements compared with a control group of voluntarily disclosing issuers.

Through this novel intensive-margin mechanism, uncertainty shocks command a quarter of the equity premium in general equilibrium.

The principal can mitigate this commitment problem by giving the most skilled agent a budget and delegating authority to write other agents' contracts. This endogenous hierarchy, never optimal with public contracts, raises effort, output, and compensation but allows rent extraction. The principal prefers it when contracts are opaque enough, skill is sufficiently heterogeneous across agents, and joint output is sensitive enough to effort. Our model provides novel predictions for the structure of banking syndicates.</jats:p>",

Our findings revise several stylized facts about U.S. housing markets. Real market rents did not fall during the postwar period in most cities and rose nationally by 60% from 1890 to 2006. We also document higher sales price growth between 1953 and 1987 relative to previous series. Real prices reached almost four times their 1890 level by 2006. Prices grew most in metros with high demand and low levels of construction. We find that the rent-to-price ratio fell from about 8% in the early twentieth century to 3% by 2006, consistent with declines in the cost of owning housing relative to renting. For the typical year in our period, the annual return to owning housing was 9%, driven mostly by rental returns of 7.7%, with capital gains contributing only 1.3%. While capital gains were close to zero from 1890 to 1940, they grew to nearly a third of total returns from 1970 to 2006.</jats:p>",

Pegger currencies depreciate relative to floater currencies and these depreciations are strongly expansionary. The boom is associated with a fall in net exports, and (if anything) an increase in interest rates in the pegger countries. This suggests that expenditure switching and domestic monetary policy are not the main drivers of the boom. We show that a large class of existing models cannot match our estimated responses and develop a model with imperfect financial openness that can. Following a depreciation, uncovered interest parity deviations lower the costs of borrowing from abroad and stimulate the economy, as in the data. The model is consistent with (unconditional) exchange rate disconnect and the Mussa fact, even though exchange rates have large effects on the economy.</jats:p>",

In our validation tests, this method achieves higher accuracy than several tested open‐source algorithms. Our main findings are as follows. First, although firms headquartered in protest‐affected counties add more Black directors, particularly in larger protests, this gain appears to largely offset the representation of other non‐Black minority directors. Second, these board‐level shifts do not consistently extend to executives or the general workforce. In contrast, a gap may emerge between a firm's workforce composition and local labor‐market demographics, particularly in the representation of Black employees. This pattern is consistent with diversity tokenism, which suggests firms may prioritize high‐visibility board appointments and potentially downplay broader, transformative change. Our findings indicate that although board‐level diversity gains are highly visible and attract notable public attention, they may not be accompanied by an organization's transformative commitment to company‐wide diversity.</jats:p>",

Relative to observably similar individuals from the same draft board, Black men randomly inducted into the Army were significantly more likely to join the nascent NAACP and become prominent community leaders in the New Negro era. We find little evidence that these effects are explained by migration or improved socioeconomic status.

An emerging view contends that if a country invoices its exports in dollars, exchange rates cannot stabilize economic activity, as the classical expenditure-switching channel is muted. This view rests on the premise that export prices are sticky in dollars, breaking the link between export demand and depreciations. But this assumption is not borne out by the data: goods priced in dollars tend to have more flexible prices, along with higher elasticities of substitution. We propose a model with more realistic assumptions and show that even with dollar pricing, depreciating the currency by loosening monetary policy can still boost exports and activity materially. The limit to any expansion is not demand, but supply capacity. We also show that low exchange rate pass-through to dollar prices is not informative about price stickiness. The price response to exchange rates is small when demand elasticities are high, even with flexible prices: low pass-through is an equilibrium result, not evidence of a nominal friction.</jats:p>",

Descriptive analyses suggest exponential growth in corporate crypto holdings and significant variation in crypto accounting practices, underscoring the rule's necessity. Hypothesis tests using the pre‐rule data reveal three insights with direct relevance to the rule. First, firms appear to view crypto assets more akin to investments than intangible assets, consistent with the rule's mandate of the fair value model. Second, Big 4 auditors steer firms toward the impairment model and less detailed presentation choices. This conservative approach is unlikely to meet the new rule's goal of providing the most decision‐useful information. Third, increased liquidity of crypto markets prompts the use of the fair value model and a more detailed presentation, consistent with the rule's focus on more actively traded tokens.

When a company becomes a sister firm through a change in the rating agency's ownership structure, its rating from that agency is subsequently upgraded, whereas its ESG ratings from other agencies remain unchanged. Sister firms exhibit greater rating disagreements across agencies than other firms. The higher ESG ratings for sister firms are partly attributable to the transfer of immaterial positive ESG information through common owners. The common ownership effect is more pronounced when the owner can exert a greater influence on the rating agency. Moreover, sister firms with initially elevated ratings demonstrate poorer future ESG performance.

Although GenAI can help investors process financial information, I theorize that the interactive nature of GenAI blurs the boundaries between investors’ own abilities and those of GenAI, prompting investors to discount their reliance on GenAI and misattribute its abilities to themselves. I rely on the advantages of a laboratory setting to disentangle the interactive element of GenAI from the mere presence of GenAI assistance. Across three experiments, I find that the interactivity underpinning GenAI heightens investors’ self‐assessments of their own abilities and increases their willingness to invest, despite this interactivity not improving, and in fact hindering, their actual processing of information provided by GenAI. My study thus highlights one potential cost of using GenAI and other highly interactive processing tools.</jats:p>",

However, when tested on actual executive speech during conference calls, their performance declines to chance levels. We thus introduce FinVoc2Vec, a deep learning model that adapts to audio recordings of conference calls and classifies the vocal tone of executive speech significantly more accurately than chance. FinVoc2Vec estimates are associated with future firm performance and can be used to construct profitable stock portfolios. Throughout our analyses, estimates from previous vocal tone models are largely unrelated to firm performance.

In an experiment where an ADA identifies a fraud red flag, we find that auditors who inherited the ADA are less likely to exercise skeptical actions than those who were personally involved in its development. We then provide evidence that informing auditors who inherit an ADA about the test development activities (e.g., a brief memorandum documenting the ADA's development) mitigates the negative effect of inheriting the ADA.

We create a panel covering most commercial banks from 1863 through 2024 to study the history of failing banks in the United States. Failing banks are characterized by rising asset losses, deteriorating solvency, and an increasing reliance on expensive noncore funding. These commonalities imply that bank failures are highly predictable using simple accounting metrics from publicly available financial statements. Failures with runs were common before deposit insurance, but these failures are strongly related to weak fundamentals, casting doubt on the importance of non-fundamental runs. Furthermore, low recovery rates on failed banks’ assets suggest that most failed banks subject to runs were fundamentally insolvent, barring large value destruction of receiverships. Altogether, our evidence suggests that the primary cause of bank failures and banking crises is almost always and everywhere a deterioration of bank fundamentals.</jats:p>",

Using a regression discontinuity design based on close presidential vote shares, we find that Southern counties where Democrats lost the popular vote between 1880 and 1900 were nearly twice as likely to experience Black lynchings in the following four years. Despite no corresponding changes in local office holding, these defeats were salient among local elites. We show that Southern newspapers, closely aligned with the Democratic Party, amplified narratives of Black criminality in the aftermath of Democratic losses. Such accusations were, in turn, frequently invoked by lynch mobs. These findings point to the strategic use of racial violence by Democratic elites, foreshadowing the institutionalized vote suppression of Jim Crow.</jats:p>",

These results are consistent with investors being subject to limited strategic thinking, which prevents them from fully unraveling the implications of strategic omissions.

Selection into attendance was limited, as the program was popular among judges of all backgrounds, frequently oversubscribed, and admitted participants on a first-come, first-served basis. We find that after attending economics training, participating judges use more economics language in their opinions, rule against regulatory agencies more often, and impose more severe criminal sentences.

Using this approach, we compute the U.S. import price index based on the Kimball demand system. We find that quality change on average lowered the inflation in import prices by around 0.007 log points annually (1989–2016). To further validate our approach, we show that it estimates price elasticities and quality changes similar to those found by the standard mixed logit (BLP) demand in data on the U.S. auto market.</jats:p>",

Migration disrupts traditional elderly support structures, in which sons live near their parents and care for them in old age. We develop a model in which dowry can promote migration by allowing sons to make upfront transfers to their parents and ease constraints on income sharing. To test this hypothesis, we collect two new data sets that measure the distribution of dowry between family members. We document for the first time that net transfers of dowry to a man’s parents are common but far from universal. Consistent with using dowry for income sharing, such transfers occur more often when sons migrate, especially when they work in higher-earning occupations. In nationally representative data, migration rates are higher in areas with stronger historical dowry traditions. Finally, exploiting a large-scale highway construction program, we show that men from areas with stronger historical dowry traditions migrate more when migration costs fall. Our findings provide some clues as to why dowry persists despite its well-documented adverse consequences.</jats:p>",

We show that the consumption externalities implied by travel itineraries are central to matching quasi-experimental evidence from the shift to working from home.

We outline assumptions under which widely used 2SLS regressions recover margin-specific treatment effects, relate these assumptions to models of judge decision-making, and derive an expression that provides intuition about the direction and magnitude of asymptotic bias when a key assumption on judge decision-making is not met. We find that noncarceral conviction (relative to dismissal) leads to a large and long-lasting increase in recidivism for felony defendants in Virginia. In contrast, incarceration (relative to noncarceral conviction) leads to a short-run reduction in recidivism, consistent with incapacitation.

Model estimates imply large effects of place on both the likelihood of transitioning to addiction and the availability of prescription opioids; they also indicate that these place effects change significantly when state laws restricting pain clinics are enacted. A one standard deviation reduction in all place effects would have reduced risky use by about 40% over our study period. One particular source of place effects, pain clinic laws, reduced risky use by 5%, but could have reduced it by 30% if they had been enacted earlier, with much of this magnification operating through the dynamics of addiction.</jats:p>",

I use these responses to estimate a dynamic model of labor supply with frictions that generate imperfect adjustment. My estimates imply that the labor supply responses to income-contingent repayment limit the optimal amount of insurance in government-provided student loans. However, these responses are too small to justify fixed-repayment contracts: restructuring existing student loans from fixed repayment to a constrained-optimal income-contingent loan—while keeping the tax and transfer system unchanged—increases borrower welfare by the equivalent of a 0.8% increase in lifetime consumption at no additional fiscal cost.</jats:p>",

Education can account for about 45% of global economic growth and 60% of pretax income growth among the world’s poorest 20% from 1980 to 2019. A significant fraction of these gains was made possible by skill-biased technical change amplifying the returns to education.
